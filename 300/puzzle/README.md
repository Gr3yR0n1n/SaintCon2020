## Story:
With the added light form the green screen, V looked around the room once more and noticed a small crack in the wall to her left. Perhaps it was there all along... V pulled on the wall and this gave way to a door that was easily opened. Inside the new room, a desk and chair with a small computer upon it. Nothing else was noticed in the room. V logged into the computer and began looking around. On the desktop, a folder name Arasaka appeared with a program inside... secret.
