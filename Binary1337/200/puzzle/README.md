# BL200 - Escape
## Author: gr3yR0n1n
## Story:
V has made it safely passed the secured door and into the room...where she slips and falls down a long tunnel, leading her to a room below. The room is dark and fairly small, as she stumbles about feeling the walls. In a small corner of the room, a glimmer of green light is pulsing. Moving closer, V notices a cover, blocking out most of the green light being emitted from the screen. She removes the cover and the screen appears to be attached to a small linux computer. There is a challenge on the screen: You find yourself in a dark room, surrounded by four walls. Choose a direction. V thinks to herself, "Well Duh!"
